> Grant's Grandiose Vision Of How Linux Should Work.

(Until [bootc](https://bootc-dev.github.io/bootc/) (the future of Linux imo) becomes more stable / daily-driveable on Arch, which I expect with the great work of the [@Bootcrew Team](https://github.com/bootcrew)  -- will come sometime in 2026... This project is just using regular ArchLinux x Btrfs snapshots. Eventually we'll move this to an Arch based bootc image, but until then I really don't suggest anyone actually daily-drive this outside of [@grantsform](https://github.com/grantsform) himself.)
