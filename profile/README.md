  <div align="center">
    (Until bootc (the future of Linux imo) becomes more stable / daily-driveable on Arch,  
    which I expect with the great work of the @Bootcrew Team -- will come sometime in 2026...  
    This project is just using regular ArchLinux × Btrfs snapshots.  
    Eventually we'll move this to an Arch-based bootc image, but until then  
    I really don't suggest anyone actually daily-drive this outside of @grantsform himself.)

### LOG
**`2025-12-05`**, it works. Sorta.
> Starting to move all my personal machines over to GrantiOS

### TODO
- [ ] Move to more api / 'action' driven workflow. 
- [ ] Port to Go, for deeper integration into CharmBracelet?
